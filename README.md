# VR-Blacksmithing
Heat up material, hammer it on the anvil and sharpen your blades in this blacksmithing game!
Sell your creations and keep your customers happy. 

# Hardware Prerequisites
- Developed and tested on HTC Vive with regular Vive wands.
- Roomscale setup with regular gen 1 lighthouses.
- Other setups may work, but are untested
- Make sure your room scale is properly calibrated via SteamVR!

# Software Prerequisites
- Install Blender (current version, not via Steam. This prerequisite should be fixed for final commit)

# Controls
- Click left and right on the trackpad to rotate the room if needed
- Use the trigger to grab items or pick up tools
- Check the commission board for incoming orders and the ratios for different weapon types.
- Heat up the ingots in the oven. Keep the temperature in the middle - otherwise, they can't be hammered and need to cool down!
- Hit the button on the anvil to start the hammering game (Note: all material needs to be in the middle temperature stage.)
- Sharpen the weapon on the sharpening stone by following the orb on the stone. 
- Place the finished weapon on the table in the sell zone to send it off to your customers!

# Material System
Larger weapons require more material - add more ingots to the hammering game to up the difficulty and create a larger, more complex weapon! Check the notice board for ratios.

# Changes from Expos√©
- Our rating system has been shelved as we playtest ways to change our minigames from binary faliure states to a gradual system. 
- Our order system has been extended and already has a scaling difficulty.
- Our temperature system fail state has been shelved as we found it to impact difficulty too much. We will reevaluate after the UI update.


- We have started on the Tutorial / Reference Post-Its already
- We have about 50% of the final models done and implemented
- We have already implemented the final recipe logic
