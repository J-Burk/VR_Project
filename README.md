# Controls

- Hit the start button to start the game
- Check the commission board for incoming orders and the ratios for different weapon types
- Heat the ingots in the oven. Keep the temperature in the middle - otherwise, they can't be hammered and need to cool down!
- Hit the button on the anvil to start the hammering game (Note: all material needs to be in the middle temperature stage.)
- Sharpen the weapon on the sharpening stone by following the orb on the stone. 
- Place the finished weapon on the table in the sell zone to send it off to your customers!

# Material System
Larger weapons require more material - add more ingots to the hammering game to up the difficulty and create a larger, more complex weapon! Check the notice board for ratios.
